    <h1>🧑‍💻 Optimizing Your LinkedIn for Data Analytics Jobs</h1>
    <div class="date">April 28, 2025 • 10 min read</div>
    <p>LinkedIn isn’t just for recruiters—it’s your public portfolio, networking hub, and often your first impression in the data analytics world. When I started out, I had no idea how much a strong LinkedIn profile could impact callbacks, referrals, and connections. Let’s break down exactly how to turn your profile into a job magnet, even if you’re still a student or transitioning careers.</p>
    <h2>Step 1: Start with a Clean, Relevant Headline</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a headline that matches your target job, e.g., <strong>“Aspiring Data Analyst | SQL, Python, Tableau | UMD ‘26”</strong>.</li>
      <li>Avoid generic phrases like “Student at University of Maryland”—employers want to see your focus.</li>
      <li>Include 2-3 key skills and your intended role.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 2: Use a Friendly, Professional Photo & Banner</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Profile photo: Clean background, good lighting, business casual if possible.</li>
      <li>Banner: Use something data-related (graphs, code, dashboard screenshot) or your school colors.</li>
      <li>Bonus: Create a free Canva banner with your name and a simple tagline.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 3: Write a Story-Driven About Section</h2>
    <p>Talk about your journey—what drew you to analytics, what problems you want to solve, and what you’re currently learning. Example:</p>
    <blockquote>
      “Hi, I’m Kyle—a data analytics enthusiast passionate about using numbers to uncover insights that make an impact. I’m currently a senior at UMD, working with SQL and Python to turn raw data into real-world solutions. When I’m not building dashboards, I’m learning more about machine learning and sharing what I learn on my blog.”
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>End with a call to action: “Let’s connect!” or “Open to internships/collaboration.”</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 4: Fill Out Experience with Action Verbs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>List internships, part-time jobs, group projects, and even coursework if you’re early in your journey.</li>
      <li>Start bullets with words like <strong>“Analyzed,” “Built,” “Visualized,” “Automated”</strong>.</li>
      <li>Include technologies used (<strong>SQL, Tableau, Python</strong>) and outcomes (“Improved reporting speed by 30%”).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 5: Showcase Projects and Certifications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Add 2-3 strong portfolio projects (school, personal, hackathon, freelance, etc.).</li>
      <li>Attach links/screenshots (GitHub, Tableau, Medium posts).</li>
      <li>Certifications: Google Data Analytics, Excel, SQL, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 6: Grow Your Network the Right Way</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect with classmates, alumni, professionals in your field.</li>
      <li>Write a brief personalized note: “Hey, I see you also work in analytics and went to UMD—would love to connect!”</li>
      <li>Join LinkedIn groups focused on analytics, data science, and your industry interests.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 7: Post, Comment, and Share</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Share your wins (“Just finished a Tableau dashboard analyzing NBA trends—link below!”).</li>
      <li>Comment on posts from others in the field; ask questions and engage.</li>
      <li>Share interesting articles, your blog posts, or insights from projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 8: Use Keywords for the Algorithm</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sprinkle relevant keywords throughout: “SQL,” “data visualization,” “predictive modeling,” “Tableau,” etc.</li>
      <li>This makes you show up in recruiter searches for entry-level analyst roles.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Final Checklist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Clear, relevant headline</li>
      <li>✅ Story-focused About section</li>
      <li>✅ Detailed Experience and Projects</li>
      <li>✅ Certifications and skills</li>
      <li>✅ At least 50 connections</li>
      <li>✅ Custom LinkedIn URL (e.g., linkedin.com/in/mikhail-tabong)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikhail-tabong/" target="_blank">My LinkedIn (see real-life example)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.mikhail-tabong.github.io/" target="_blank">My Website & Blog</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.alyssagilmer.com/linkedin-analytics-guide/" target="_blank">LinkedIn Analytics Guide</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>My Biggest Lessons</h2>
    <p>When I finally landed my first analytics internship, almost every recruiter said, “I found you on LinkedIn.” It’s worth the effort. Your profile is your personal brand—keep it up to date, stay active, and keep learning. Feel free to reach out if you want feedback on your profile!</p>

    <h1>📊 Essential SQL Skills Every Data Analyst Needs</h1>
    <div class="date">May 3, 2025 • 10 min read</div>
    <h2>Why SQL Is Non-Negotiable</h2>
    <p>SQL is the language of data, used by nearly every analytics and BI tool out there. Mastering it means unlocking the ability to pull, wrangle, and interpret real business data. Most dashboards, reports, and product insights start with a query.</p>
    <h2>Top SQL Skills and Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SELECT statements:</strong> for basic queries</li>
      <li><strong>JOINs:</strong> (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) for combining tables</li>
      <li><strong>WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY:</strong> for filtering and aggregating</li>
      <li><strong>Window functions:</strong> (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, SUM OVER, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Subqueries and CTEs:</strong> (WITH clauses) for complex logic</li>
      <li><strong>Case statements:</strong> for conditional analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Indexes:</strong> for query performance</li>
      <li><strong>Basic data cleaning with SQL:</strong> Removing duplicates/nulls, fixing errors in query</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
    <p>Almost every internship or class project I did started with SQL: finding customer churn, sales dashboarding, survey analysis, or prepping data for Tableau. Even building Tableau dashboards often starts with a custom SQL query!</p>
    <h2>Practice Resources</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/" target="_blank">LeetCode SQL</a> — Practice SQL interview questions</li>
      <li><a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/" target="_blank">Mode SQL Tutorial</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-sql" target="_blank">HackerRank 10 Days of SQL</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.sqlbolt.com/" target="_blank">SQLBolt Interactive Lessons</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pro Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Always comment your queries for clarity—especially in team settings.</li>
      <li>Get comfortable reading and editing other people’s SQL.</li>
      <li>Practice with real, messy data—open data portals, Kaggle, or your own exported spreadsheets.</li>
      <li>Use window functions to make your queries more powerful and concise!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bottom line: If you can write, explain, and debug SQL queries, you’re already ahead of 80% of applicants for entry-level analytics roles.</p>

    <h1>🛠️ Building a Portfolio to Land Your First Analytics Job</h1>
    <div class="date">May 10, 2025 • 10 min read</div>
    <h2>Why Portfolios Matter</h2>
    <p>In analytics, your portfolio proves what you know. It's your chance to show—not just tell—what you can do. This is especially crucial if you’re pivoting careers or don’t have direct experience yet. I landed my first real analytics role by sending my portfolio link with my application!</p>
    <h2>What to Include</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>3-4 well-documented projects:</strong> Each should have a clear business question, methods, and results. Example: “Sales trend dashboard for Superstore data.”</li>
      <li><strong>Skills in context:</strong> SQL queries, data cleaning scripts, Tableau dashboards, and Python notebooks.</li>
      <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Screenshots, process write-ups, and GitHub/website links.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Portfolio Project Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sales data dashboards (Superstore, public e-commerce datasets)</li>
      <li>Survey analysis with visualizations</li>
      <li>Spotify or Netflix usage trends (use public APIs or Kaggle datasets)</li>
      <li>NBA/NFL stats visualizations</li>
      <li>Predictive models: churn, housing prices, or disease outcomes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Showcase Platforms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> — for code & notebooks</li>
      <li><a href="https://public.tableau.com/" target="_blank">Tableau Public</a> — for dashboards</li>
      <li>Your own website (like <a href="https://mikhail-tabong.github.io/" target="_blank">mine</a>) — for curated, professional presentation</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tips for a Strong Portfolio</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Make your README files clear and friendly. Explain your thought process for each project.</li>
      <li>Use real-world datasets and explain business value.</li>
      <li>Don’t overload your portfolio. 3-5 great projects > 10 quick ones.</li>
      <li>Write a blog post or LinkedIn summary for each project—employers actually read these.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>A solid portfolio can open doors even before you get your first analytics job. Invest the time, show off your personality, and share it everywhere you can.</p>

    <h1>🤖 How Much Machine Learning Do You Really Need?</h1>
    <div class="date">May 18, 2025 • 10 min read</div>
    <h2>Analytics vs. Data Science vs. ML</h2>
    <p>Not every data analyst needs to build neural networks, but basic ML is becoming a core part of many analyst roles. Knowing the basics makes you more flexible—and more marketable. I started with classification and clustering projects (think: customer churn prediction, clustering Spotify users by genre) and that alone set me apart from other applicants.</p>
    <h2>Essential ML Topics for Analysts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Supervised learning (classification, regression)</li>
      <li>Unsupervised learning (clustering, PCA)</li>
      <li>Train/test splits and cross-validation</li>
      <li>Metrics (accuracy, F1, confusion matrix, AUC-ROC)</li>
      <li>Bias, overfitting, and fairness basics</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Real-World Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Predicting customer churn with logistic regression</li>
      <li>Segmenting customers using clustering</li>
      <li>Forecasting sales with time-series models</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Learning Resources</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning" target="_blank">Coursera ML Specialization (Andrew Ng)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/" target="_blank">scikit-learn Tutorials</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning" target="_blank">Kaggle ML Crash Course</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tips for Analytics-Focused ML</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus more on explaining results than just building models.</li>
      <li>Include at least one ML project in your portfolio, but tie it to a real business problem.</li>
      <li>Practice model evaluation and storytelling: “What does this accuracy mean for the business?”</li>
      <li>Don’t overpromise—ML is powerful, but communicate its limits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Showing some ML knowledge helps you stand out, but your superpower as an analyst will always be making data actionable for non-technical audiences.</p>

    <h1>📍 My Data Analytics Roadmap</h1>
    <div class="date">May 29, 2025 • 10 min read</div>
    <h2>How I Got Started (And Why Slow Is Fast)</h2>
    <p>Before I started seriously building projects and applying for internships, I spent around 6–8 months diving deep into the fundamentals of data analytics. It wasn’t a fast process, but it was a rewarding one—and the time I invested upfront paid off later when I was working on real-world problems in class and during internships.</p>
    <h2>Step 1: Google Data Analytics Certificate</h2>
    <p>I began in October 2024 with the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Data Analytics Certificate</a> on Coursera. It made concepts like data cleaning, visualization, and SQL/R basics approachable.</p>
    <h2>Step 2: Projects (School & Personal)</h2>
    <p>After two months, I started building real projects—school assignments, public data sets, and anything that interested me. These hands-on experiences were more valuable than any textbook. Each project grew my confidence with Python, Tableau, and real data wrangling.</p>
    <h2>Step 3: Exploring Data Engineering & Science</h2>
    <p>I dabbled in <strong>data engineering</strong> (ETL, pipelines, database design) and <strong>data science</strong> (predictive modeling, clustering). This gave me a big-picture view and let me talk shop with engineers and scientists alike.</p>
    <h2>🗺️ My 6–8 Month Timeline</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Month 1–2:</strong> Google Data Analytics Certificate (Coursera)</li>
      <li><strong>Month 3:</strong> Started building small projects from school assignments</li>
      <li><strong>Month 4:</strong> Learned SQL, Tableau, Python basics</li>
      <li><strong>Month 5:</strong> Completed first full project with dashboard and write-up</li>
      <li><strong>Month 6:</strong> Explored ML basics and started a classification project</li>
      <li><strong>Month 7–8:</strong> Improved GitHub portfolio, started blogging, and networking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>My Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Treat learning like a part-time job—block time each week and track your progress.</li>
      <li>Ask business questions for every project. “How would a company use this analysis?”</li>
      <li>Communication is key: practice presenting results, not just coding them.</li>
      <li>Document your journey—GitHub, Notion, a blog, whatever works for you.</li>
      <li>Add at least one ML project, but focus on business value.</li>
      <li>Don’t rush. Deep understanding beats shallow tutorials every time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>🧠 Grind Mindset: How to Start in Data Analytics</h1>
    <div class="date">June 17, 2025 • 25 min read</div>

    <p>Every day you delay is a day someone else takes your spot. In the competitive world of data analytics, hesitation can cost you opportunities. But motivation isn't just about hype; it's about building habits that push you forward—even when you don't feel like it.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Fear of Starting</h2>

    <h3>1. The Overwhelm of Coding</h3>
    <p>Sitting in front of a blank screen, staring at lines of code that might as well be hieroglyphs. It's normal to feel overwhelmed. But remember, every coder started as a beginner. The key is to embrace the discomfort and keep going.</p>

    <h3>2. The Anxiety of Cold Emails</h3>
    <p>Reaching out to professionals can feel intrusive. But cold emailing is a powerful tool for networking. Crafting a concise, personalized message can open doors and provide insights that accelerate your learning.</p>

    <h2>Setting Realistic Goals</h2>
    <p>Aiming to become a data analyst in a week is unrealistic. Instead, set SMART goals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Learn SQL basics.</li>

      <li><strong>Achievable:</strong> Dedicate 30 minutes daily.</li>
      <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Align with career objectives.</li>
      <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Achieve within 1 week.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Breaking down your journey into manageable steps makes the process less daunting and more achievable.</p>

    <h2>Building a Sustainable Routine</h2>

    <h3>1. Embrace the 1% Rule</h3>
    <p>Focus on improving by just 1% each day. Over time, these small gains compound, leading to significant progress.</p>

    <h3>2. Implement the Pomodoro Technique</h3>
    <p>Work in focused intervals, such as 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break. This method can enhance concentration and prevent burnout.</p>

    <h3>3. Celebrate Small Wins</h3>
    <p>Successfully executing a Python script or cleaning a dataset is a victory. Acknowledge these moments to build confidence and maintain motivation.</p>

    <h2>Networking: Turning Cold Emails into Warm Connections</h2>

    <h3>1. Research Before Reaching Out</h3>
    <p>Understand the background and interests of the person you're contacting. This allows you to tailor your message and increase the likelihood of a response.</p>

    <h3>2. Craft a Compelling Subject Line</h3>
    <p>Your subject line should be concise and relevant. Personalize it to catch the recipient's attention without being overly casual or formal.</p>

    <h3>3. Keep It Brief and Professional</h3>
    <p>Busy professionals appreciate brevity. Get to the point quickly, and always proofread your email before sending.</p>

    <h2>Continuous Learning: Staying Updated in a Rapidly Evolving Field</h2>
